# Teal Demos

To get started, create a new Python [virtual environment][1] and install Teal:

```shell
pip install teal
```

Run the initial Teal program:

```shell
teal service.tl
```

Then deploy and invoke it:

```shell
teal deploy; teal invoke
```

Then, copy any of the files in `examples` into `service.tl`!

See [Getting Started][2] for more details.
